**Great Features**

- Centralized Location: flutter_gen creates a consolidated Assets class, serving as a one-stop shop
  for accessing all your assets. This eliminates the need for remembering and using lengthy
  string-based paths, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- Type Safety: The generated Assets class enforces type safety, preventing errors due to typos or
  incorrect asset paths. This improves code reliability and reduces debugging time.
- Easy AssetImage Creation: You can conveniently create AssetImage objects using dot notation,
  making code more concise and reducing the likelihood of errors.
- Multiple Asset Providers: flutter_gen supports generating code for various asset providers, such
  as AssetBundle, NetworkImage, and FileImage, providing flexibility in how you handle your assets.

Main Points / Purpose Of Lesson

1. Manage Assets

The Structured Main Content

1. Managing the paths to our Assets, Fonts, and Colors is error prone, therefore we want to use a
   code generator that automatically creates a path to our assets, fonts, and colors based on our
   pubspec yaml file.
